étudier (to study) will drive a (non-headless) browser to collect a citation
graph from Google Scholar. It's non-headless because Google is very protective
of this data and routinely will ask you to solve a captcha (identifying street
signs, cars, etc in photos). étudier will allow you to complete these when it
happens and then it will continue on its way collecting data.

Currently it outputs a gexf file that you can load into Gephi.
